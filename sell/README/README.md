  ### Discription about images: 

    -- in the above image i have use flex box for positioning like in the left side 1 div and right side 1 div, so in left div i use ul and li for links and in right div again create a div section for cards and in that cards div again create div for single card so that how i made the section of my web page

    ```
    ```


  ### 1st image : 
         In the 1st image i have use flex box for positioning and for those blue wave svg i have use transform: scaleX for make it mirror view or flip it.
         and by appling transform: scaleX(1) on downward div so that the content will appare front.

  ```
  ```

  ###  2nd image : 
         In this image 2 i have just use nested divs for positioning by using flex-box and make a each item border shadow.

```
```

  ###  3rd image : 
         In this image i use a iframe tag for adding youtube video like youtube will already give a iframe tag to add videos on another websites

```
```

 ###   4rd image : 
         same as the 1st image i have use wave as a background image and make its position absolute.

```
```

###     5th, 6th, 7th and 8th image:
         above all this images of responsiveness with different width.
         for reponsiveness : in sell page i have add some height and width of heading tag and paragraph tag to make a font-size  small

```
```

###   Yours Learning 

```
```

 ### 1.  HTML :
       The main thing i have learn in the project that how we can make a html structure because without a strong skeleton whole body is not good fit for that we need to understand how to structure navbar or cards for that we can use div under divs divs under divs so that it can be properly structures

```
```

###  2.  Git and GitHub:
        The another thing i have learn while making project is how team work on the same project at a same time with different location by using git and github. command like pulling before pushing so that our code will upadate based on that code.

```
```

###  3.  CSS :
        before this project i have use units like px etc but by making this project i introduce to vmin and vmax, rem, % etc so this relative tags are very important for responsive website so mostly i have use vmin, rem & % and very less use of px unit or absolute units.

```
```

###  4. classes naming: 
        this is also very usefull for my pages like naming a classes is very important i have name a classes like 1st div is section1
        so 2nd div is section2
        if we created nested div in section2
              then
              .section2-items
                  s.ection2-items-card

         like that i have use classes naming.
