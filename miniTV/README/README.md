Description:

1st Image -- There are three items in the navBar and used flex properties. 
When we click on any of the link then colour will be changed because its targeting the ancor tag.
Added tooltip in the Icons.
Also there is hero_section which is done by the inbuild css3 Animation Keyframes and property I have used is "left"
which is used to horizontal positioning 0-5% after that it will moved to -110vw 10% then moved to -200vw and so on.position is relative. 

2nd Image -- I have used external javascript liberary owl_carousel and used flex properties position relative.
So that it gets slides.

3rd Image -- Footer section is all about images where I have just used flex properties to for alingment and add tooltip in the social images.
