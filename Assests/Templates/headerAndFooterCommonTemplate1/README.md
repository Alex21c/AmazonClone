My Learning 
  1. there is :focus-within property which get triggers whenver user is typing something on the input field 
  2. using position:sticky & z-index css rule i can make the page header section appear on top of webpage even when scrolling
  3. Grid layout can be used to position multiples items in random order as desired, used it inside header section when the responsive design screen max-width reached to 860px, there were 6 items, and needed to be arranged in particluar order without modifying the html structure.
